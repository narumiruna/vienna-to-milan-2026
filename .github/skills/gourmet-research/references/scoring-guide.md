# Scoring Guide: 50-Point Rubric

Detailed guidance for applying the 50-point scoring system to food venues.

## Rubric Components

Each component scored 0-10, total = 50 points.

### 1. Taste/Quality (0-10)

**What to assess**: Food quality, authenticity, technique execution, ingredient quality

**Scoring guidelines**:
- **9-10**: Exceptional - Outstanding flavors, perfect execution, premium ingredients
  - Example: Michelin-starred restaurant with innovative technique and flawless dishes
  - Indicators: Multiple reviews praise specific dishes, chefs have acclaim, unique preparation methods
  
- **7-8**: Excellent - High-quality food, well-executed, authentic
  - Example: Traditional trattoria known for perfect carbonara, local favorite
  - Indicators: Consistent praise for signature dishes, good technique, fresh ingredients
  
- **5-6**: Good - Solid quality, satisfactory execution, acceptable ingredients
  - Example: Reliable neighborhood restaurant with decent but not memorable food
  - Indicators: Generally positive reviews, few complaints about food quality
  
- **3-4**: Fair - Mediocre quality, inconsistent execution
  - Example: Tourist restaurant with acceptable but uninspired food
  - Indicators: Mixed reviews, some complaints about taste or freshness
  
- **0-2**: Poor - Low quality, poor execution, questionable ingredients
  - Example: Tourist trap with pre-made food, poor preparation
  - Indicators: Frequent complaints about food quality, authenticity questioned

**Evidence to look for**:
- Specific dish praises/complaints in reviews
- Chef credentials or awards
- Signature dishes mentioned repeatedly
- Comparisons to other venues
- Photos showing presentation and portions

### 2. Value (0-10)

**What to assess**: Price relative to quality, portion sizes, overall worth

**Scoring guidelines**:
- **9-10**: Exceptional value - Outstanding quality at reasonable price
  - Example: €15 pasta that rivals Michelin restaurants
  - Indicators: Multiple reviews mention "great value", "worth every euro", "surprisingly affordable"
  
- **7-8**: Good value - Quality justifies the price
  - Example: €35 tasting menu with excellent food
  - Indicators: Price aligned with quality level, fair portions
  
- **5-6**: Fair value - Acceptable but not impressive
  - Example: €20 pizza that's good but not exceptional
  - Indicators: Few comments on value either way, standard pricing
  
- **3-4**: Poor value - Overpriced for quality delivered
  - Example: €40 mediocre pasta
  - Indicators: Reviews mention "overpriced", "not worth it", small portions
  
- **0-2**: Terrible value - Significantly overpriced
  - Example: €60 for tourist-trap food
  - Indicators: Frequent complaints about being ripped off

**Evidence to look for**:
- Price ranges mentioned in reviews/websites
- Value comments in reviews
- Portion size feedback
- Comparisons: "cheaper than X but better quality"
- Menu prices if available

### 3. Convenience (0-10)

**What to assess**: Location accessibility, reservation difficulty, hours of operation, waiting times

**Scoring guidelines**:
- **9-10**: Highly convenient - Easy to reach, flexible hours, walk-in friendly
  - Example: 5-min walk from hotel, open late, no reservation needed
  - Indicators: Central location, accessible by public transport, walk-ins accepted
  
- **7-8**: Convenient - Reasonable location, manageable reservations
  - Example: 15-min metro ride, reservation needed but available
  - Indicators: Good transport links, booking possible with 3-5 days notice
  
- **5-6**: Moderately convenient - Some challenges but workable
  - Example: 30-min commute, advance reservation required
  - Indicators: Not central but reachable, needs planning ahead
  
- **3-4**: Inconvenient - Difficult access or booking
  - Example: Remote location, 2-week advance booking minimum
  - Indicators: Limited hours, hard to reach, long advance booking needed
  
- **0-2**: Very inconvenient - Major practical barriers
  - Example: Requires 1-hour travel, 1-month advance booking
  - Indicators: Extremely difficult to access or secure reservation

**Evidence to look for**:
- Distance from accommodation
- Public transport access (metro stops, bus lines)
- Reservation requirements and lead times
- Operating hours (especially closures, lunch/dinner only)
- Queue waiting times mentioned in reviews
- Seasonal closures or holidays

### 4. Consistency (0-10)

**What to assess**: Reliability across reviews, time periods, different dishes

**Scoring guidelines**:
- **9-10**: Highly consistent - Uniformly positive across sources and time
  - Example: 4.5+ stars on all platforms, no pattern of decline
  - Indicators: Recent reviews match older ones, all sources align, few negative outliers
  
- **7-8**: Consistent - Generally reliable with minor variations
  - Example: 4.0-4.4 stars consistently, occasional off-day mentioned
  - Indicators: Strong pattern of positive reviews, minor inconsistencies explained
  
- **5-6**: Moderately consistent - Some variation but generally predictable
  - Example: 3.5-4.0 stars, some mixed reviews
  - Indicators: Quality varies by dish or time, some reviewer disagreement
  
- **3-4**: Inconsistent - Significant variation in experiences
  - Example: 3.0-3.5 stars, many mixed reviews
  - Indicators: "Hit or miss" comments, quality varies widely, decline over time
  
- **0-2**: Very inconsistent - Unreliable, unpredictable
  - Example: 2.5 stars, wildly different experiences
  - Indicators: Equal positive and negative reviews, major quality swings

**Evidence to look for**:
- Rating alignment across platforms (Google, Tripadvisor, etc.)
- Recent vs older reviews comparison
- Comments about consistency: "always good", "hit or miss", "used to be better"
- Review count and distribution (many 5s and 1s = inconsistent)
- Specific inconsistency mentions (service, food quality by dish)

### 5. Risk (10 = low risk, 0 = high risk)

**What to assess**: Likelihood of disappointment, potential issues

**Reverse scoring**: 10 = minimal risk, 0 = high risk

**Scoring guidelines**:
- **9-10**: Minimal risk - Safe choice, reliable
  - Example: Well-established, consistently praised, clear strengths
  - Indicators: Minimal negative reviews, no red flags, clear value proposition
  
- **7-8**: Low risk - Minor concerns only
  - Example: Popular place with rare complaints
  - Indicators: Few concerns, minor issues (e.g., "can be crowded")
  
- **5-6**: Moderate risk - Some concerns but manageable
  - Example: Good food but service issues noted
  - Indicators: Notable weaknesses documented, mixed experiences
  
- **3-4**: Elevated risk - Significant concerns
  - Example: Inconsistent quality, frequent service complaints
  - Indicators: Multiple red flags, unreliable experiences
  
- **0-2**: High risk - Likely disappointment
  - Example: Tourist trap indicators, many negative reviews
  - Indicators: Strong evidence of problems, declining quality, scam reports

**Risk factors to assess**:
- Tourist trap indicators (aggressive touts, no locals visible)
- Hygiene concerns mentioned in reviews
- Service issues (rude staff, incorrect billing)
- Recent decline in quality
- Practical impossibility (always fully booked, unpredictable hours)
- Seasonal uncertainty (closed during visit dates)
- Language barriers causing order issues

## Scoring Process

### Step 1: Gather Evidence
Collect information from all 4+ sources, noting specific examples for each rubric component.

### Step 2: Score Each Component
Work through each of the 5 components (Taste, Value, Convenience, Consistency, Risk), assigning 0-10 based on evidence.

### Step 3: Calculate Total
Sum the 5 scores (max 50). Note: This is objective addition, not subjective weighting.

### Step 4: Document Rationale
In notes.md, briefly justify each component score with evidence references.

### Step 5: Verify Interpretation
Check total score against interpretation:
- 40+: Excellent → Top Pick
- 35-39: Very good → Top Pick
- 30-34: Good → Backup
- <30: Consider exclusion

### Step 6: Cross-Check
Verify the score feels right given the evidence. If not, re-examine component scores.

## Common Scoring Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Michelin-starred restaurant far from hotel
- Taste/Quality: 10/10 (exceptional food)
- Value: 6/10 (expensive but justified)
- Convenience: 4/10 (40-min travel, advance booking required)
- Consistency: 9/10 (Michelin standards)
- Risk: 9/10 (minimal, established reputation)
- **Total: 38/50** → Top Pick (despite inconvenience, quality justifies effort)

### Scenario 2: Local trattoria with authentic food
- Taste/Quality: 8/10 (excellent traditional dishes)
- Value: 9/10 (very reasonable prices)
- Convenience: 9/10 (walk from hotel, walk-ins ok)
- Consistency: 8/10 (reliable, slight quality variation)
- Risk: 9/10 (safe choice, well-established)
- **Total: 43/50** → Top Pick (excellent all-around option)

### Scenario 3: Popular tourist cafe with average food
- Taste/Quality: 5/10 (acceptable but not special)
- Value: 4/10 (overpriced for quality)
- Convenience: 8/10 (central location, easy access)
- Consistency: 5/10 (variable quality)
- Risk: 5/10 (some tourist trap concerns)
- **Total: 27/50** → Consider exclusion (convenience doesn't compensate for quality/value issues)

### Scenario 4: Hidden gem gelato shop
- Taste/Quality: 9/10 (exceptional gelato, artisanal)
- Value: 9/10 (great prices)
- Convenience: 7/10 (15-min walk, sometimes long queues)
- Consistency: 8/10 (consistently praised)
- Risk: 9/10 (low risk, strong reputation)
- **Total: 42/50** → Top Pick (worth the walk and potential queue)

## Handling Edge Cases

### Insufficient Evidence
- If evidence is lacking for a component, mark as "TBD" and prioritize additional research
- Don't guess; document uncertainty explicitly
- Consider lower risk score if information is sparse

### Conflicting Evidence
- Weight more reliable sources (local food guides > tourist blogs)
- Look for patterns across multiple sources
- Document the conflict in notes.md
- Adjust consistency score down if major conflicts exist

### Seasonal/Temporal Issues
- Adjust convenience score for seasonal closures
- Note timing constraints in practical info
- Increase risk score if visit timing is uncertain

### Price Range Ambiguity
- Use mid-range if exact prices unavailable
- Compare to similar venues in city
- Note uncertainty in value justification

## Quality Assurance

### Red Flags Requiring Score Reduction
- Any hygiene concerns → Reduce taste/quality and increase risk
- "Used to be good" comments → Reduce consistency, possibly taste
- "Tourist trap" mentions → Reduce taste, value, increase risk
- Service problems → Increase risk
- Persistent booking difficulties → Reduce convenience

### Green Flags Supporting Higher Scores
- Local recommendations (Reddit, local blogs) → Support quality
- Awards/recognitions → Support quality, consistency
- Long establishment history → Support consistency
- Specific dish praises → Support quality
- "Best X in city" claims from reliable sources → Support quality
