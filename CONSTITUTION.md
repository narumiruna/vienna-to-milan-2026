## Research Process

- Research MUST follow an evidence-based approach.
- Candidate places MUST be discovered before evaluation.
- Evaluation MUST be based on multiple independent sources.
- Negative reviews MUST be analyzed for their underlying concerns and risk types, not treated as noise or outliers.
- High aggregate ratings MUST NOT be assumed to reflect low risk without negative review analysis.
- Candidates MUST be triaged into shortlist or exclusion.
- Final outputs MUST reflect comparative judgment, not raw listings.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- Cities, dates, and travel order are **fixed** and treated as immutable inputs.
- The project scope is **food only**; accommodations, transport, attractions, shopping, and nightlife are excluded.
- **Alcohol is excluded**; alcoholic beverages and alcohol-focused venues are not allowed, while food-focused venues that incidentally serve alcohol are acceptable.
